# Neighborhood-Map Project

## About
This is an single page application featuring a map of Saska Kepa (Warsaw, Poland) neighborhood.
Functionality:highlighted locations, third-party data about locations (Foursquare) and various ways to browse the content.

The neighborhood map application is complex enough and incorporates a variety of data points that it can easily become unwieldy to manage. 
There are a number of frameworks (KnockoutJS, Jquery), libraries and APIs (Foursquare, Google Maps) used to make this project more manageable.
